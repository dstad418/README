Hi there!

My name's Dylan, and i've been collaborating on Software Engineering projects recently in order to get a better understanding of 
computer scinece as a whole. I've been a blast learning new languages, implementing theory to make things greater than the sum
of their parts- and collaborating and competing on several projects that have shown me how much i've grown in this short time.
I'm open to work, depending on the projects, and open to collaboration, and maybe will
be doing some open-source contributions in the future. 
I can be reached at: herrigstadd@gmail.com

Cheers!
